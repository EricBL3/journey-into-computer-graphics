# My Journey into Computer Graphics

In this project I will follow the [syllabus](https://graphicscodex.com/syllabus.xml) & [projects](https://graphicscodex.com/projects/projects/index.html) suggested in the Graphics Codex. These are the resources I will follow:

* [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (5th edition)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57281611-fundamentals-of-computer-graphics)
* [The Graphics Codex](https://graphicscodex.com/)
