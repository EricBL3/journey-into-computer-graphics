# Main algorithms

Describe main algorithms of program with pseudocode or diagrams

## makeCube()

## makeCylinder()

## generateHeightField()

## generateDrinkingGlass()

# Implementation design

Summarize your implementation design in no more than two paragraphs. Provide sufficient information to 
aid future implementors seeking to reproduce your work. Why did you make the program this way? What were your 
main iteration structures? What were the key G3D routines that you used?

# Results

## Cube

## Cylinder

## Heightfield

## Drinking Glass

# Demo Scene

Images without wireframe

# Questions

1. G3D uses some real-time rendering tricks to fake reflections of the sky, but if you fly along the shore of my island, you'll see that the water doesn't actually reflect the mountains. How could you simulate the image of the missing reflection in a plane of water or a mirror using only nonreflective 3D models?

2. The underlying renderer converts all models into triangles, which you can see in the wireframe renderings. Why are triangle meshes the preferred primitive compared to, say, quadrilaterals, which would be more space efficient and are often easier for modeling?

3. The regular tessellation we used for heightfields is inefficient. It will allocate the same number of triangles for flat portions of the heightfield that need few triangles as for very hilly ones that need many to accurately represent the shape. Propose an alternative algorithm for computing a more efficient triangular tessellation for a given heightfield. Do not actually implement your algorithm. You may invent one on your own or use external resources to discover existing algorithms.

# Reflection

Describe what you learned while working on this project. Distinguish software engineering, algorithmic, 
and mathematical skills. Include the reading and ideas that you had to implicitly work through even if not required.
