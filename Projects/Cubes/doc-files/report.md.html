**Cubes Report**

# System Overview

The project is based on the starter template of G3D. The main class for this project is called App and it contains
all the methods for initializing and loading the 3D scenes. The only modification that I did was to add the generateStaircaseFile() 
method. This method is used for generating automatically the staircase scene.

# Coordinate System

G3D uses a left-hand coordinate system.

# Process for custom scene

When creating my custom scene I initally had the idea of doing something Halloween themed because of the date. 
I looked for online resources and generated a cubemap that looks like there's a big moon. The idea was to create 
a scene inspired by the movie "The Nightmare Before Christmas". However, representing the scene with just cubes would 
involve a very large amount of time and I didn't want to spend any more time than necessary considering that this project 
just aims to teach me the basics of the 3D engine and how other projects will be structured.

In the end, I decided to base it on the design of a Dia de Muertos skull that I found online. I manually added the 
specifications for each model and for each entity. To do this more efficiently I also used the scene editing GUI.

# LaTeX equation

\begin{equation}
    \frac{df(x)}{dx} = \lim_{h\to0} \begin{bmatrix}
                                    \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}
                            \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

# Questions

1. What are the differences between the Scene* and shared_ptr<scene> data types in C++?
    
    Scene* is a normal pointer, which means that you have to manually manage its memory during its lifetime.
    Meanwhile, a shared_ptr is a pointer that uses reference counting to automatically manage the lifetime of the object. This makes it easier and safer to use.

2. How does G3D know where the scene files are located?

   The current directory is specified in the settings of the G3D GApp object. Then, whenever a new scene has to be loaded 
    using loadScene() you just have to pass the name of the scene.

3. Why should you to put your initialization code into App::onInit instead of constructor App::App? (Tip: There are many reasons. Try throwing an exception from each, and consider the implications of throwing an exception from a class's constructor.)

    The initialization code should be put in the onInit function because when this function runs, the object already 
    exists on memory. This means that you are able to throw and catch exceptions.

4. What is the call chain that invokes App::onGraphics3D?

    GApp::run -> GApp::onInit -> GApp::onWait -> GApp::onGraphics -> GApp::onGraphics3D

5. Where is the file cube.obj stored on the file system? How did the Scene parser know to load it from there?

    It's located in 'g3d\data10\common\model\cube\cube.obj'. The scene parser knows to load it from there becase it 
    has the common directory in the path of the scenes. This means that you just need to specify the path from there.

6. You can create a material in a scene file from a Color3. There are many more ways to construct a G3D material, however. One of these takes separate lambertian, glossy, emissive, and transmissive values. Speculate on why a homogeneous material (i.e., one without a pattern or image) would require four separate 'colors' in its specification.

    The material requires 4 separate colors because each one will affect a different property of the material.

# Reflection

This first project allowed me to get some hands-on practice and start familiarizing myself with the G3D engine.
Besides, I also started familiarizing myself with the requirements for the projects and how to handle the journal and the report.

# Time

It took me a total of 11.52 hours to complete this project.

3.25 hours were spent in the warmup section and installing and setting up G3D

The remaining 8.27 hours were spent doing the specifications and report of the project.
