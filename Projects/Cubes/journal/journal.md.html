2023-11-02: Finishing the interesting scene
=============================================================

![Dia de muertos skull](2023-11-02__000_Dia_de_muertos_skull.jpg)

This is what my final scene for dia de muertos looks like!


2023-10-31: Change of plans for interesting scene
=============================================================

![Dia de muertos skull](2023-10-31__000_Dia_de_muertos_skull.jpg)

I decided to change my idea for the interesting scene to be related to Dia de
muertos. It'll be a skull with ornaments.


2023-10-28: Start with interesting scene
=============================================================

![Halloween!](2023-10-28__002_Halloween_.jpg)

My interesting scene will be halloween themed. I alredy got the textures,
cubemap and a pumpkin model.


2023-10-28: Generate staircase file automatically
=============================================================
![Final staircase image](2023-10-28__001_Final_staircase_image.jpg)

This is what the generated staircase with a wood texture looks like



![First attempts](2023-10-28__000_First_attempts.jpg)

The initial attempts of generating a staircase automatically create this image.
I still need to adjust the angles and positions for the steps


2023-10-25: Specification 2
=============================================================
![Cornell box](2023-10-25__003_Cornell_box.jpg)

Finished the cornell box



![Scale convention](2023-10-25__002_Scale_convention.jpg)

The project description uses cm as the convention for the scale. However, I
believe that this is too small so I will use the convention of each value equals
1m.
As you can see, the transformed cube model in the middle is supposed to
represent the wall of the cornell box using the conventions of the project
description. Meanwhile, using my conventions makes everything appear bigger and
easier to see.


2023-10-25: Specification 1
=============================================================

![White cube](2023-10-25__001_White_cube.jpg)

A single, white 1 m3 cube rotated 45° about the vertical axis, with center at
(0m, 0m, −2m), created by manually editing a scene file.


2023-10-12: testing journal
=============================================================
